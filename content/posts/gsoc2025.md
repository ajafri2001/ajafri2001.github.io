## Introduction

This is going to be _(hopefully)_ a weekly series of blog posts covering the technical details of the stuff implemented by me and my mentor [@tgodik](https://github.com/tgodzik) for Scala Center GSOC 2025. This will be the first post in the series and I'll cover what has been done so far in the first week of the coding period.

The first week has a bit of a special circumstance since even though the coding period began in June 2nd of this year, I had asked my mentor if we could start early and have an extra month for free ðŸ˜….

In hindsight that was the best thing I could've done since that extra time was proved to be really helpful and was put to good use.

## Stuff Accomplished so far

Okay, so far me and my mentor have managed to get a couple of stuff done. The first thing to do is get the editor/client to recognize `.scala.html` files. - TODO
